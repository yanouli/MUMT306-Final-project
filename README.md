# MUMT306-Final-project
#Have you ever come across this anime girl studying with a pair of headset on YouTube? For me, this YouTube channel called lofi girl which livestreams lofi hip hop music has companied me for countless late night study sessions. Lofi hip hop is also called chill hop, it is a form of downtempo music that combines elements of hip hop and chill-out music. I like to have it on as background music while I’m studying because I found the perfect balance of the chill-out and upbeat vibes helps me stay awake and focused. Therefore, for this final project I decided to make a lofi hip hop beat maker so that I’ll have a more interactive and fun way to play my study music.
